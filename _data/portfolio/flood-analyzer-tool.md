The [World Resources Institute (WRI)](http://wri.org) is committed to promoting sustainable use of our natural resources. We partnered their Aqueduct team to build a Web tool helping them raise awareness about flood risks and climate change impacts by visualizing more than a million data point related to river flood impacts, and estimating the damage to GPD and urban populations.
