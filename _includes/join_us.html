<p>We’re not only nice people, we do very interesting work:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>We do sh*t that matters</strong>, working on our own stuff (like <a href='http://devo.ps'>devo.ps</a>) and building products for folks you may have heard of like the World Bank or the UN, things like leveraging Open Data to visualize poverty and education, or designing election platforms (not kidding).</li>
    <li><strong>We take care of our team.</strong> We will get you the gear you want (Macbook, ergonomic chair, standing desk... just ask for it), flexible working hours (and no overtime), paid personal leave, snacks, foosball competitions, WiiU play time, weekly team lunches, team-building events and <strong>our yearly company trip (this year was Berlin and Prague for 2 weeks)</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>We spend a lot of time experimenting with new things</strong>. Most of us are dabbling in 2 or 3 fields and we love it when folks decide to learn new stuff (on company time obviously).
  <li><strong>We’re very transparent about anything that goes at the company and let people assume the role they feel comfortable with</strong>. If you feel like you can do a better job by taking over something, it’s most likely people will be happy to let you try.
  <li><strong>We’re distributed, with folks in Berlin, Shanghai, and the US</strong>.</li>
</ol>
