For the past 4 years, we've been helping with organizing the main Javascript event in China; [JSConf China](http://jsconf.cn). We took it first to [Shanghai](http://2012.jsconf.cn), then [Beijing](http://2013.jsconf.cn) and, last year, [Hangzhou](http://2014.jsconf.cn). **This year, we'll be going to [Shenzhen](http://2015.jsconf.cn)**.

## About JSConf China

JSConf China is a two day conference focused on JavaScript and Node.js technologies. We bring together notable figures from both the Chinese and international JavaScript communities to share their knowledge and passion for JavaScript.

We brought 237 developers together in 2012, then 318 in 2013 and 525 last year in Hangzhou. We expect to do a whole lot better this year.

## Why Shenzhen?

There were many factors but in short:

1. **The local community**; there are a lot of interesting companies, both startups and giants (Tencent for example), as well as incubators and hacker spaces ([Chinaccelerator](http://chinaccelerator.com/), [ChaiHuo](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/Chaihuo)).
1. **The location**; Shenzhen is right across the border from Hong Kong. It will prove much more convenient for international speakers to fly to and get a Chinese visa from. We also expect folks from Macau, Guangdong and all over the [Pearl River Delta](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_River_Delta) to be able to attend.

## What we need help with

If you want to help, head over the [GitHub issue queue](https://github.com/jsconfcn/ShenJS/issues). We need help with a few things:

- **[We're still looking for a venue](https://github.com/jsconfcn/ShenJS/issues/1)**. We have a few options but still think we could find a better deal and use more efficiently the funds we'll raise for the event. If you have a suggestion, please share it. There are plenty of universities for example that could host an event for around 500~700 people.
- **[We need sponsors](https://github.com/jsconfcn/ShenJS/issues/7)**. We've been preparing a brochure we'll share with you in the next few days with all the details.
- **[We're gonna start looking for speakers](https://github.com/jsconfcn/ShenJS/issues/14)**. We'd love for local speakers to be more present. Taobao? Baidu? Alibaba? Tencent? Lots of people are doing cool things with Javascript in China. Obviously, we'll be bringing international speakers as well so don't be shy.
- **We're still fiddling with the dates**, as we're [trying to avoid conflict with both international and local events](https://github.com/jsconfcn/ShenJS/issues/8). It will happen this summer though, most likely in July.

You can get in touch with us on [Weibo](http://weibo.com/jsconfchina), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jsconfcn) or by joining the [public Slack chat](https://shenjs.herokuapp.com/) (thanks Guillermo for [slackin](http://rauchg.com/slackin/)).

**[Subscribe to our newsletter on the ShenJS website](http://2015.jsconf.cn) as well, we'll let you know when the tickets are available**.

We'll try and run things as transparently as possible on GitHub, as [we do with pretty much everything else](http://wiredcraft.com/blog/github-for-everything/) at [Wiredcraft](http://wiredcraft.com).
