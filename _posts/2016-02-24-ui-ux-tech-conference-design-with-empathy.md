[Gabriel Jorby](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabrieljorby) from [960dots](http://960dots.com/) explores **the notion of empathy and how it's related to UI/UX**, how it helps to think about the user experience and designing interface. Wiredcraft organizes monthly [Meetup for UI/UX designer](http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-UI-UX-Designers-Meetup/) to gather the community and invite brilliant minds to share their ideas on the mic. This talk was part of the Meetup organized in January 2016 and hosted at [Imagination](https://shanghai.imagination.com).
