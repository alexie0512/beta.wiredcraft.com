We're about to head to France for DrupalCon Paris and though we'd gather for one more edition of our meetups. Me, Makara and Stingna will talk about a couple things we've been working on respectively lately. If you feel like joining us, just check the address on groups.drupal.org (http://groups.drupal.org/node/25234), we'll start things around 6:00 PM (depending on how many people are already there).

<!-- more -->

A little preview of what we plan on talking about:

* **MemCache**: How to speed up your Drupal site? by Makara Wang,
* **Features**: Building reusable components with Drupal by Ronan Berder,
* **Theme techniques**: Bend Drupal to your will using theme overrides and preprocessing functions by Stingna Zhou,

Hope to see you there!
