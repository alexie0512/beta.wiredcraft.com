On Friday, the Wiredcraft team went fast. Really fast. 

Every month, Wiredcraft hosts a team-building event. In the past, we've gone rock climbing, had a pizza-making competition, went to batting cages etc... 

This September, we went go-karting and enjoyed a delicious, spicy team dinner at a local Thai restaurant. 

As we whipped around the track, our competitive sides were brought out, but we all had a great time. You can't see, but we promise big smiles were under those helmets.

Who is the fastest Wiredcraft team member? 

That'd be Vincent, our R&D virtuoso. Vincent had our fastest lap at 34.84 seconds and a top speed of 23.48 m/s.

When we weren't cheering our other team members on, we drinking at the watering hole (aka. a pitcher of Asahi) and playing foosball and pool. 

This was a great opportunity for our two new team members to get to know the rest of the team.
