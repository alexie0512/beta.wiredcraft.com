Wiredcraft is passionate about Open Source. And along with our passion for Open Source comes our commitment to fostering the Chinese Open Source community. We’re helping grow China’s Open Source community by relaunching [Shanghai Open Source](http://wiredcraft.com/shanghaios/en.html) and helping organize [JingJS](http://jingjs.org/).

JingJS is a conference in Beijing bringing together JavaScript developers from around the world. Held from November 9th through November 11th, JingJS presenters will share the latest on node.js, Grunt.js, tools, and frameworks to build awesome platforms. The Wiredcraft team will be there too. Look out for our t-shirts wee think you’ll like them :)

While Beijing is awesome we’ll also be at [Shanghai’s upcoming QCon](http://www.qconshanghai.com/). Held from November 1st through November 3rd, QCon is a developer-led conference promoting innovation in technology.
