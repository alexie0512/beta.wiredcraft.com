[Patrick Johnson](http://shanghaiappmaker.com/) from [Shanghai Appmaker](http://shanghaiappmaker.com/) will be speaking on “Rapid Generation of APIs Using Sails.js.” With the evolution of ‘the modern web’, website development requirements are frequently changing, and data driven front-end heavy apps are becoming increasingly common. Sails.js is a MVC framework, based on NodeJS and ExpressJS, for rapidly generating REST API’s to consume using AJAX/Websockets. Patrick will demonstrate the advantages of this framework, specifically focusing on how quickly one can leverage Sails to save large amounts of development time, which can then be appropriated to the front-end, where it’s needed the most.

[Rita Zhang](https://ritazh.com/) from [Microsoft](http://www.microsoft.com/) will be speaking on "Coding in the Open: Open Source at Microsoft.” Rita is an Open Source Engineer at Microsoft, hacking away with engineering teams inside Microsoft, open source communities, and startups. In this talk, she will candidly and openly talk about how open source is used inside Microsoft, how folks team up with communities outside the Microsoft ecosystem, and what the Redmond company is doing to make developers working in a bunch of diverse environments happy.

[Chriest Yu](https://github.com/jcppman) from [EF Labs](http://careers.ef.com/categories/technology/learning-labs/) will talk about "How I Keep Bower Happy Behind the Wall." Due to some "unknown reasons", resources abroad are hard to fetch when 
client is inside China, this makes bower unhappy. Chriest's talk will be about the story of
fighting against The Wall.
