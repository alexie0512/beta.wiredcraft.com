The next edition of the [Hacker News Shanghai meetup](http://wiredcraft.github.com/hnshanghai/) will be held on October 27, 2011 at [Abbey Road](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=abbey+road,+shanghai&hl=en&ll=31.209204,121.45051&spn=0.020628,0.038409&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=39.047881,78.662109&vpsrc=6&hq=abbey+road,&hnear=Shanghai,+China&t=m&z=15&iwloc=A) starting 7:00 PM; as usual, look for the table with a "招财猫" ("Lucky Cat"). First round of beers will be on us, along with some snacks.

We'll be happy to chat anything nerdy enough; may this be the latest technology we're getting excited about (node.js, Elastic Search, Sphinx, Python, GIS, Puppet, Android, jQuery, Drupal, backbone.js...), the latest big acquisition or your own project, come for a couple hours of discussion with likely minded folks. This event is pretty informal; no definite track or presentation, just a bunch of tech addicts chatting around a few beers and snacks.
