This is another edition of our monthly Drupal meetup; if you are in Shanghai and want to learn more about Drupal, just come around. We are all Open Source enthusiasts and we'll be happy to answer any of your questions .

<!-- more -->

In the light of the recent addition of Simplified Chinese to [Localize.Drupal.org](http://localize.drupal.org/translate/languages/zh-hans), we will present the fundamental concepts of multilingual features in Drupal;

* How to install and set Drupal in Chinese,
* How to modify Drupal translations,
* How to build a language package and how to collaborate,

Be prepared to hear a lot about l10n (localization) and i18n (internationalization). See you this Thursday, 18:00 at [Wiredcraft's office](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=wiredcraft&hl=en&cd=1&ei=9PtoS_urNqLmugO2gumvDQ&sig2=E4qlWEwJwEPAQcKBLtqJIQ&ie=UTF8&view=map&cid=12880717171376201607&ved=0CBsQpQY&hq=wiredcraft&hnear=&ll=31.222509,121.45905&spn=0.009652,0.019205&z=16); 172 Jinxian Lu, Luwan District, Shanghai (duh!).
