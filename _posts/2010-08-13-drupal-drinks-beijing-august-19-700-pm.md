On its way to DrupalCon Copenhagen, the Wiredcraft team will stop by Beijing to catch a flight to Europe. We would like to use that opportunity to meet the Beijing Drupal community in person; we propose you to join us at [Paddy O'shea's](http://www.dianping.com/shop/2467099) next Thursday for some drinks, snacks and a lot of Drupal. All levels are welcome of course; if you have questions about what Drupal can do, or how to use Drupal for your personal needs, we'll be happy to share our expertise. Come and mingle with other Drupal geeks!
