There are a lot of documentation in China with more or less obscure names. Those can get even more complex when you do not read (with a certain proficiency) chinese. There are also various types of official materials; stamps, certifications, licenses, IC cards, etc. I will walk you through the major ones in a series of posts.

One of the most used, and believe me it is required more often then you could expect, are the stamps. Each copy of any official papers need to be stamped. Each contract need to be stamped. Payroll or accounting papers need to be stamped. The first few times are quite fun, you really feel like you have an administrative power. And this stamping sound "tchak" is quite rejoiceful. This is quickly fading away under the number of times the task has to be executed. Anyhow, let's have a short list of the most important one;

* The **Official seal** (公章); contains the registered name of the company and is approved by the governement. It can combine the official name in chinese and english. It is used to prove the legality of the company and needs to be used for all official documents from the copy of the business license to the payroll sheet submitted to your accountant.
* **The Financial seal** (印鉴章) contains the financial information of the company and is used for all the bank related services. It is composed of the term financial seal (财务专用章) and the official chinese name of the company with the term. Bank require this to open an account and any transactions that require paper work.
* **The Invoice seal** (发票专用章) contains the tax number of the company. It is used to officialize invoices.
* **The Bank information seal** (三排章) contains the account number along with the information related to the bank's branch. It is mainly used to provide our bank information which is not quite often in our age.
* **The Identification seal** (法人章) is the personal identification seal. It is used to proved the identity of key members (such as the founder) for financial purposes and is usually used along with the Financial stamp.

Stamps do not have to be held by the same person, it can even be an issue as some of those are tedious to get. There are mainly components that come along to get through the administrative tasks in China, stay tuned for more informations about this delightful part of the business.
