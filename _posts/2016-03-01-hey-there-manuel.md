Manuel joins the Shanghai Wiredcraft team as a Front-end Developer. While pursuing his Bachelor's in Germany, he found himself traveling back and forth between China and Germany, finally settling in China about two years ago. He studied online media management at university, so he has a broad knowledge of online technologies and how they work. Manuel is bringing his expertise in blending design and development to the Wiredcraft team. 

In his free-time, Manuel likes to travel and work on private projects. He is a bit of a foodie and loves trying new restaurants in Shanghai.
