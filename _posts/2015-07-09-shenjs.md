With 18 sponsors and 21 speakers we have no doubt that this weekend will be jam-packed with fascinating people, talks, and events. We will be covering a lot of awesome topics from building robotics with node.js, data architecture with JavaScript front-end frameworks and even how to create a Nerd Disco using JavaScript. Things will get funky!

### Geeky Gadgets

Six drawings will happen during the conference and after-party. Lucky winners will take home prizes donated by our sponsors: XiaoMi products, books, a Raspberry Pi and other glorious geeky gadgets.

Once we finish our JavaScript filled weekend, we are going to pack up and jet-set to Berlin for the Tech Open Air Conference for a well deserved rest after the release of the [Myanmar Voter Registration system](//wiredcraft.com/blog/myanmar-township-voter-registration-pilot/) .
