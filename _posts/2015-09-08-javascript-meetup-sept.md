![JavaScript Meetup Shanghai](http://wiredcraft.com/images/posts/js-meetup-08.png)

The Shanghai JS Ninjas will meet again this month on September 14th at 7pm. 

We want to be able to fit all of our attendees so we are trying out a new venue. (Thank you [People Squared](http://www.people-squared.com/))

We will be meeting at: 

> **People Squared**
> 1st Floor, No. 3 Building, 28 East Yu Yuan Road, Jing'an District,
> **上海创客中心**
> 静安区愚园东路28号3号楼1层 上海创客中心

Wiredcraft will be providing the pizza and drinks for the Meetup.

We had a very successful August Meetup with a presentation by Fraser Xu on Restful APIs in Node.js and a lightning talk by Tobias Nickel on his first success on npmjs.com with a smart XML parser. 

We have three great presentations for the September Meetup. Get ready from some JS awesomeness. 

Here is the tentative schedule:

Time | Activity
--- | ---
19:00 | Start Pizza and Mingle (Welcome Sign-In Sheet)
19:20 | **Tobias Nickel: Orm using sequilizejs / Bookshelfjs**
19:40 | Q&A for Tobias
19:50 | **David Guan: Introduction webpack /  Demonstrate how to build a react component (using webpack as helper)/Introduction flux** 
20:20 | Q&A for David
20:30 | **Baruch Berger: Rapid app prototyping with short development cycles**
20:50 | Q&A for Baruch
21:00 | Lightning Talks
21:10 | Job Opportunities
21:15 | Goodbye and thank you to the sponsors

If you have something to share, we’d love to hear about it; we'll have time set aside for lightning talks at every Meetup.

We hope to see you at JS Meetup Shanghai! Get there early for pizza and remember to RSVP on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-JavaScript-Meetup/)
