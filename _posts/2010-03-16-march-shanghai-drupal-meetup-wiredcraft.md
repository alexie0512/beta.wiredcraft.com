We had a [poll](http://groups.drupal.org/node/53143) a week ago, and it looks like the Shanghai community of Drupal addicts is more interested in holding meetups on weekends. Since the weather is gettings nicer, we decided it was time to put back together an offer nobody seems to resist; Drupal and BBQ!

Saturday, March 27, 2010, we will organize the March edition of the Shanghai Drupal meetup and, if the weather allows it, we'll have a BBQ on the rooftop of [our office](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=wiredcraft&sll=31.22152,121.459055&sspn=0.009652,0.019333&ie=UTF8&hq=wiredcraft&hnear=&ll=31.222234,121.45905&spn=0.010166,0.019205&z=16&iwloc=A) starting from 13:30 PM. Feel free to bring anything you feel like grilling (or drinking) and don't hesitate to comment on the [announcement on groups.drupal.org](http://groups.drupal.org/node/55843) about topics you'd like to see explained or want to present! Beginners are more than welcome.

If you can't make it or if you just can't wait until then, [we'll also have a quick "geek out" tonight](http://groups.drupal.org/node/54893#comment-156608), 7:00 PM, at [The Chalet](http://cityweekend.com.cn/shanghai/listings/nightlife/bars/has/the-chalet/) (385 Yongjia Lu, near Taiyuan lu). The idea is simple; drinks and Drupal chit-chat.
