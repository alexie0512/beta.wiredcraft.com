With the temperature rising every days, we can feel the heat crushing summer coming. As number of people in the street is increasing, the number of events is decreasing; here is our pick for this month.

<!-- more -->

* **[Startup Weekend Beijing](http://startupweekendbeijing.com/en/page/home) (Friday, 24th June, 6:00pm to Sunday, 26th June, 10:00pm)**; a 54-hour event allowing SoLoMo (social, local, mobile internet) entrepreneurs to gather and meet each other as well as meetings VCs and perhaps get a funding. *Address: The Opposite House, The Village Building 1, No. 11 Sanlitun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing.*

And don't forget the upcoming [Shanghai Open Source Meetup](http://wiredcraft.com/blog/shanghai-open-source-meetup-lets-get-started) on July 2nd.
