We've been busy through the summer, managing to tackle quite a few things:

* A complete rebrand of Wiredcraft, including a new logo and the magnificent site you're reading this post on.
* A new location: San Francisco. We'll be welcoming our new business manager soon who will work along with Ronan and the US team out of the beautiful [Parisoma](http://www.parisoma.com/) co-working space.
* We have a whole new set of Open Source projects we'll be gradually releasing in the next 4 weeks. Expect a lot of Javascript (AngularJS, node.js, D3.js) and CouchDB.

A few more things we'll be pushing in the next few months:

* [Hackers + Founders](http://wiredcraft.com/hackers-founders); our weekly meetup for entrepreneurs and... hackers. If you like technology or are involved in a startup, you'll probably find yourself right at home.
* [Shanghai Open Source](http://wiredcraft.com/shanghaios); a monthly micor-conference with lightning talks from members of the local Open Source community as well as hands-on workshops on some of the newest things: Vagrant, Go, node.js...
