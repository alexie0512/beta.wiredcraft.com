We have been a few leading the Drupal User Meetups in Shanghai for about a year and, sadly, did not get much time to organize it for the past few months... But we are back now: this Saturday, in the same building as Wiredcraft's office, we will gather one more time to talk about our beloved Drupal.

<!-- more -->

Join us on Kangding Lu and Wuning Nan Lu, we'll do our best to show what we can do with Drupal:

* [Jacopo Alabiso](http://drupal.org/user/333964) will introduce the combined use of the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/services">Services</a> module and Flash.
* [Ronan Berder](http://drupal.org/user/49057) (myself) will introduce some basics of grid-based designs and grid frameworks.

Below are the details that you can find on [Shanghai's Groups.Drupal.org page](http://groups.drupal.org/node/22394):

* Date & time:  May 23, 2009 - 2:00 PM
* Address: Building C, 4/F, 1147 Kang Ding Lu, Shanghai (on [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&source=s_q&hl=en&geocode=&q=wiredcraft+%E5%BA%B7%E5%AE%9A%E8%B7%AF&mrt=all&sll=31.232326,121.437206&sspn=0.009467,0.019226&ie=UTF8&ll=31.232069,121.435189&spn=0.018935,0.038452&z=15&iwloc=A))
