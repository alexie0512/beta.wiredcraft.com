We had a few busy months and have created quite a few new modules for both Drupal 6 and Drupal 7. While we are still cleaning the bigger ones, we thought we would publish a few simple ones. We are right in the middle of the Drupal.org Git migration so these haven't found their home on Drupal.org yet; we're very much looking to do so next week with the new infrastructure. Without further ado;

<!-- more -->

* **[douban](http://github.com/wiredcraft/douban)** (Drupal 6); [Douban](http://douban.com) is one of the top sites in China, providing user review and recommendation services for movies, books, and music. This module allows users to log in using their Douban account.
* **[highlight.js](http://github.com/wiredcraft/highlight_js)** (Drupal 7); provides a very simple integration of the awesome *highlight.js* script from [Ivan Sagalaev](http://softwaremaniacs.org/soft/highlight/en/). Why another syntax highlighter? Well, first this one detects automatically the language without additional syntax (and that's pretty handy when you are Markdown addicts as we are, not willing to specify the language in an odd HTML attribute), moreover it offers an awesome set of themes.
* **[feedback_lite](http://github.com/wiredcraft/feedback_lite)** (Drupal 6); is a **very** simple simple feedback module that makes use of the sitewide contact form. Other feedback modules already exists on Drupal.org, but we needed a very light one that would be easily themed for our client projects.

More new modules coming up in the next couple weeks; stay tuned.
