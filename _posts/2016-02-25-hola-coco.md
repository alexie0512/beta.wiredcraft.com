Coco joined the Shanghai Wiredcraft team as an Online Marketer. Before coming to Shanghai, she studied, worked and lived in the UK, the US, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Spain. As a curious human being, she picked up four majors: economics, communication, sociology and psychology during her studies. She always tends to see the world in a different way, and likes to apply this to her work. She brings her experience in events and public relations from many different industries including journalism, finance, arts and start-ups to the Wiredcraft team. 

Coco cares about environmental issues, the LGBT community and a sharing economy. Her inquisitive nature lends to her interest in communication and making new friends. She loves capoeira, stand-up comedy, rock climbing and salsa.
