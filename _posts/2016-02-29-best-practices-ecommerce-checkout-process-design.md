Have you looked at your analytics to see just how much of your leads are abandoning their carts during their visit?

What are the main mistakes that shops make? What are the best practices in the field of e-commerce? What is an efficient checkout process, built with sales in mind from the beginning?
In January, Gabriel Jorby showed us how to understand our clients' habits with [the notion of empathy design](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/ui-ux-tech-conference-design-with-empathy/).
[Vincent Xiang](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/yxiangeclille/) works with the checkout process for B2C online shops at [Paypal](http://www.paypal.com/). He was kind enough to be our speaker in the February UX talk, where he answered all our burning questions.
