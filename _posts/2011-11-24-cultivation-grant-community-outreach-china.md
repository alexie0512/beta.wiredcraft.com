A few weeks ago, the Drupal Association announced its [second round of Drupal Community Cultivation Grants](https://association.drupal.org/node/13534); this pilot program is dedicated to funding various initiatives from within the Drupal community, focusing on events (meetups, sprints, DrupalCamps...) as well as various community outreach and evangelization projects.

Having been involved in the Asian community for the past few years, we decided to propose launching a 6 months community outreach campaign in China intending to, through organizing Drupal meetups in various cities, help grow local initiatives, identify community leaders and improve the overall collaboration between these isolated communities.

We are thrilled to announce that our application was accepted and will, for the next few months, help organize meetups in Nanjing, Beijing, Guangzhou, Hanghzou and Shanghai. We will send a Drupal expert to each of these locations on a schedule that we'll publish very soon; they'll deliver a couple high quality presentations and will intend to imrpove collaboration on the ground.

We're already busy at finalizing the logistic of the whole thing but are eager to hear from local Drupalers (or Open Source enthusiasts really) who want to participate.
