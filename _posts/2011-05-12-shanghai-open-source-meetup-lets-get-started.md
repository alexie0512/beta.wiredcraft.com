Several of our team members have been involved in one way or another in some of the tech events that are taking place in Shanghai, helping organizing Barcamp and DrupalCamp as early as 2008. We have been helding regular meetups in Shanghai (and even held one in Beijing) for the past 3 years and have been considering for a while now extending these meetups to all Open Source technologies; we feel that by doing so we will be in a much better position to leverage the local scene and foster initiatives.

So here we go; we are putting together resources to hold a monthly Open Source meetup in Shanghai. May your thing be Ruby on Rails, Android, Linux, Node.js, Puppet, PHP, Solr, Erlang, or (really) anything else Open Source, feel free to drop by or even propose a presentation. We all know that it takes more than one technology to be a geek; let's share what we know.

We are still figuring out some of the details, but we hope that some people will propose some sessions. We will ourselves fill in with a couple proposed talks;

* **Introduction to Sphinx and Searchlight**; introduction to a powerful search server, [Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com), and its Drupal implementation [Views](http://drupal.org/project/views)-driven, [Searchlight](http://drupal.org/project/searchlight).
* **Full text search with Sphinx**; full text search is a complex problem that has generated quite a few projects on its own, including [Sphinx](http://sphinxsearch.com).
* **Speeding up your Web application; various caching approaches**; common approaches to improve performance and scale a Web app (think Memcache, reverse-proxy, load balancing, opcode and the likes).

The first edition of the Open Source meetup will take place in [Anken Green](http://www.ankengreen.com/);

* Time: July 9, 2:30 PM
* Address: [Anken Green ](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=668+Huai+An+Rd.&hl=en&sll=31.230393,121.473704&sspn=1.362169,2.458191&z=16) (Rooftop, 668 Huai An Road, Zhabei District, Shanghai)
