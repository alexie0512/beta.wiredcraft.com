It's already time for the [August edition of our monthly Drupal meetup](http://groups.drupal.org/node/85429).

With temperatures around 40 degrees and humidity going beyond 70% some days, we're having a hell of a summer. And while we, humans, are struggling to make it through the day, let's take a couple minutes and think about our cherished servers that are running our sites. I doubt that in these conditions they really enjoy seeing Drupal getting their CPU to skyrocket. Let's give them a hand!

This session will focus on performance with Drupal and the upcoming DrupalCon in Europe. Here are the planned track so far;

* **Performance and Optimization, speeding up your Drupal site**, by Ronan Berder. We will talk about the performance bottlenecks you may experience when deploying a Drupal site as well as their remedy, from identifying the sources of the problems to applying the adequate answer. If you're interested in learning about Varnish, Boost, Memcached, Opcode, Zabbix, Munin and overall anything related to caching or server monitoring, you don't want to miss that one.
* **DrupalCon Copenhagen**; voice the opinion of the Chinese community, Makara Wang, Howell Hu and Ronan Berder. A few of us at Wiredcraft will be heading soon to DrupalCon CPH which starts on August 23 in Danemark; come and share with us your thoughts on the Chinese Drupal community and what you would be interested in sharing with the rest of the Drupal ecosystem.

And as usual, feel free to reach out to us if you want to give a presentation. See you next Sunday.

* Time: August 15, 2:00 PM
* Address: <a href="http://wiredcraft.com">Wiredcraft</a>'s office: Room 309, 228 Meiyuan Lu, Zhabei District, Shanghai
* Closest metro station: Hanzhong Lu Station (Line 1)
