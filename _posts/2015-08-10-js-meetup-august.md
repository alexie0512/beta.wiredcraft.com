July was a busy month for JavaScript in China with over 650 JavaScript developers meeting in Shenzhen for 48 hours of nerding out at [JavaScript Conference China 2015](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/toa-shenjs/).

We want to continue that fun. Join us tonight in Shanghai for the JavaScript meetup at our office tonight (August 10th) at 7pm . You can find the event details and RSVP [here](http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-JavaScript-Meetup/events/201810192/#event-comments-section).

We will have talks on:

1. Using express to build restful api
2. Using Loopback.io to build complex and production ready restful api

Feel free to share your own projects or ideas!

If you can't make it tonight, no worries, we have JavaScript meet ups every month. [Subscribe to our blog](http://wiredcraft.us2.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=18eb8d6c34ad5d4e781541da9&id=920ba635d7) and we will keep you up to date.

We hope to see you there.
