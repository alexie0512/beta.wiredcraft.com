Mik studied computer science at Edinburgh University. He moved to Shanghai eight years ago as a developer, and over a series of large projects worked his way up to Scrum Master, senior developer, and finally, Product Owner of Germany's largest dating website. Mik enjoys making and playing synthesizers, homebrewing, and woodworking. He also likes to code in his free time; if you're up for a challenge, code a robot to fight Mik's robot here: [http://fightcodegame.com/profile/mpathiuk/](http://fightcodegame.com/profile/mpathiuk/).
