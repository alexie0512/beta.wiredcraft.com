![Guten Tag, Berlin](http://wiredcraft.com/images/posts/guten-tag-berlin.jpg)

Wiredcraft is coming to Berlin. The office will open in December and we will be welcoming new staff members for our Berlin office (if you want to join our team you can see our [available positions.](http://wiredcraft.com/about/)) We can't wait to get involved with the startup and international development communities in Berlin.

The staff from our Shanghai office are heading to Berlin on July 14th to attend the [Tech Open Air Conference](http://toa.berlin/) and have a well deserved rest after the release of Myanmar voter registration system (more technical information about it coming soon in our blog).
