As we [previously announced](http://wiredcraft.com/blog/cultivation-grant-community-outreach-china), our application for a [chinese community outreach](http://wiredcraft.github.com/drupal_tour/) has been accepted by the Drupal Association in this year cultivation grants. We decided to connect with the various local communities of China (namely Chengdu, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Shanghai and Bejing) and help them organize meetups; as we believe this will strengthen communities at a local level as well as a national one.

Our first destination is Chengdu, widely known for its pandas. With a great deal of help from the local Drupal community (thanks [HyperGlide](http://groups.drupal.org/user/838059) for your strong support), we finally ironed all inherent details of such an even and are happy to share the relevant information;

* **When?**; 25 February 2012, from 2pm to 5pm.
* **Where?**; an event place and book store, [The Bookworm](http://wwww.chengdubookworm.com), located at [2-7 Yujie East Road](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=2+Yujie+East+Street,+Chengdu,+Sichuan,+China&hl=en&ie=UTF8&sll=30.714334,103.975846&sspn=0.357738,0.616608&oq=2+yujie&hnear=2%E5%8F%B7+Yu+Jie+Dong+Jie,+Wu+Hou+Qu,+Chengdu,+Sichuan,+China&t=m&z=16) (near Ren Min South Road)
* **How much?**; it is completely free!
* **Who?**; you of course, as well as other members of the local and chinese community.
* **What?**; various presentations will take place, for beginners but also Drupal experts (presentations will include topics such as *Introduction to Drupal 7*, *How to use Git*, *How to make your patch* or *How to collaborate with the community*). Of course, if you are willing to make a presentation, do not hesitate and contact us via the [Drupal Community Weibo page](http://event.weibo.com/322513).

We are very excited to make our first stop of this 4 months trip around China promoting Drupal and the Open Source community in whole. See you all in Chengdu.

# Drupal交流研讨会的第一站：成都

一如我们[最近发布](http://wiredcraft.com/blog/cultivation-grant-community-outreach-china) 的，我们关于Drupal的[中文交流活动](http://wiredcraft.github.com/drupal_tour/) 得到了Drupal协会的支持。我们决定联系一些中国的地方团体（成都，广州，深圳，厦门，杭州，南京，上海和北京）来帮助他们组织Druapl交流会，我们相信这将有助于全面提高各地方组织的Drupal水平。


我们的第一站是成都——这座以熊猫闻名的城市。有幸得到[HyperGlide](http://groups.drupal.org/user/838059)的帮助，我们非常高兴地与各位分享如下信息：

* **时间**：2012.2.25 下午2点至5点
* **地点**：[老书虫吃喝读](http://wwww.chengdubookworm.com)，地址：[成都市武侯区玉洁东街2号（近人民南路）](http://ditu.google.cn/maps?q=%E5%9B%9B%E5%B7%9D%E7%9C%81+%E6%88%90%E9%83%BD%E5%B8%82%E6%AD%A6%E4%BE%AF%E5%8C%BA%E7%8E%89%E6%B4%81%E4%B8%9C%E8%A1%972%E5%8F%B7%E8%80%81%E4%B9%A6%E8%99%AB%E5%90%83%E5%96%9D%E8%AF%BB&hl=zh-CN&ie=UTF8&ll=30.622541,104.066062&spn=0.006647,0.011362&sll=30.622301,104.063112&sspn=0.006647,0.011362&brcurrent=3,0x36efc5aac93da5bf:0x12df634e8bb620ed,0,0x36efc4118ed93a77:0xc6a94eaa59689390%3B5,0,0&hq=%E8%80%81%E4%B9%A6%E8%99%AB%E5%90%83%E5%96%9D%E8%AF%BB&hnear=%E5%9B%9B%E5%B7%9D%E7%9C%81%E6%88%90%E9%83%BD%E5%B8%82%E6%AD%A6%E4%BE%AF%E5%8C%BA%E7%8E%89%E6%B4%81%E4%B8%9C%E8%A1%972%E5%8F%B7&t=m&z=17)
