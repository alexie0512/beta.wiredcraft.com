![Wiredcraft Berlin Office](https://wiredcraft.com/images/posts/berlin-wunderbar.jpg)

Last summer, [we flew our whole team to Germany and the Czech Republic for a well deserved break](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/guten-tag-berlin/). We also announced that we would be opening up an office here in Berlin. After a lot of beer, Wurst and Schnitzel, we did just that.

**You can now find Wiredcraft GmbH i.G. at Axel-Springer-Str. 54B in Berlin**.

[Dominika, our first local employee](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/willkommen-dominika/), will be joined by 3 other staff members by next month. Given the insane amount of awesome applications we received, we're pretty sure we'll be growing at a steady pace.

**If you're looking for a team to help you design, build and scale your Web or mobile product, [give us a shout](https://wiredcraft.typeform.com/to/GG4GQz)**. We're known to dabble in a wide range of technologies (React, Golang, Node.js, Python...), tools (Ansible, Docker, ...) and occasionally design hardware. [We're also suckers for good UI and UX](https://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/).
