"The crime that shames us all" is a [32 billion USD](http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/comment-analysis/WCMS_181922/lang--it/index.htm) industry, benefitting from 21 million people. And [33 percent](https://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/glotip/GLOTIP_2014_full_report.pdf) are children. As technology has progressed, it has come to play a pivotal role in the human trafficking industry.

Over time, advancements in technology have restructured the ways in which human traffickers (and their businesses) operate; large scale trafficking has become simultaneously more profitable and more complex. Though, as technology can connect human traffickers to their victims, it also can serve to catch traffickers in action.

## How do human traffickers use technology?

The rise of information exchange through web and mobile technology has provided more opportunities for traffickers to target victims more efficiently, through a screen, with the click of a button. Soliciting victims through [online job advertising](http://communicationleadership.usc.edu/pubs/USC_Tech%20and%20Labor%20Trafficking_Feb2015.pdf) proves to be faster, more efficient, less expensive (than traditional billboard or newspaper advertising), and ultimately less risky (especially if you're [anonymous](http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/how-to/internet/what-is-dark-web-how-access-dark-web-deep-3593569/)). 

Victims, often recruited through anonymous online advertisements seeking models, nannies, and domestic servants abroad, relocate to accept jobs and arrive to face very different sets of job descriptions. According to [USC's 2015 report](http://communicationleadership.usc.edu/pubs/USC_Tech%20and%20Labor%20Trafficking_Feb2015.pdf) on technology and labor trafficking, migrant workers, often disconnected from technology and their social networks, are more susceptible to human trafficking. 

As record numbers of [war refugees](http://syrianrefugees.eu/) are moving across borders, [their disconnection and mobility represent business opportunities](http://astanatimes.com/2015/07/lets-use-un-world-day-against-trafficking-in-persons-to-help-end-this-crime/) for human traffickers. But as more and more human traffickers are using technology to recruit victims, the importance for the use of [technology and open data to fight human trafficking](https://agenda.weforum.org/2015/02/how-data-can-help-fight-human-trafficking/) becomes evident. 

## How can technology be harnessed to stop human trafficking?

[Polaris](http://www.polarisproject.org/), an anti-trafficking NGO that runs a US-based human trafficking hotline, [National Human Trafficking Resource Center (NHTRC)](http://www.traffickingresourcecenter.org/), has partnered with Palantir to map locations of reported human trafficking cases. Using this information, Polaris [analyzes migration patterns and designs attacks](https://www.polarisproject.org/what-we-do/data-analysis-program) on these human trafficking networks using **open data**, big data, and insights from the hotlines.

In an effort to [alter the risk-reward environment](http://mscorpnews.blob.core.windows.net/ncmedia/2015/06/Tech-Human-Trafficking-Whitepaper.pdf) for human traffickers by making human trafficking a riskier (technologically speaking) and less-lucrative industry, Microsoft has developed [software and services](https://news.microsoft.com/apac/2015/06/22/fighting-human-trafficking-with-technology/) such as [PhotoDNA](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/photodna) and the Child Exploitation Tracking System (CETS), to grow citizen awareness, prevent trafficking recruitment, and expose existing trafficking.

On an individual level, [Eric Schles](https://github.com/EricSchles/data_festival_2015), a New York-based data scientist, has been [fighting human trafficking using Python](http://podcastinit.com/episode-12-eric-schles-on-fighting-human-trafficking-with-python.html). He developed [TraffickingGrab](https://github.com/EricSchles/traffickingGrab), a tool to scrape websites for evidence of human trafficking, and explains in a podcast how he uses Selenium and mechanizes Tor to scrape the deep web.
