In February, at a design event Wiredcraft organized in Shanghai, Crayon Hsieh from SapientNitro humorously examined the biggest differences you need to understand in user interface and usage habits.

Crayon explored the complexity and diversity of the "app-scape" in China, which, in short, is less focused on the App Store and Google Play, with a large section devoted to customized apps and different user interfaces, especially for login, navigation, and payment.

The first part of Crayon's talk was about user interface: the login and payment process, the large number of marketplaces for apps, Pinyin, QR codes, voice messaging, and the differences in navigation paths.

Later, Crayon talked about the notion of privacy in Chinese apps, the extensive use of chat apps, digital wallets, comment boards, and emoji habits.

During the questions, Crayon gave a very interesting answer about the link between interface and cultural factors and its place in the design process.
