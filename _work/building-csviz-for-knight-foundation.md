The Knight Foundation turned to Wiredcraft to provide an open source project that alows users to generate a system that allows to easily enter datasets, edit them and generate visualizations automatically. The system encompasses a list of csv files with multiple countires, indicators and years and is optimied so that non-technical users can easily use. We integrated the system directly with github.
