New America is an American non-proft, nonpartisan public policy institute and think tank focusing on a wide range of issues, including national security studies, technology, asset building, health, gender, energy, education, and the economy.

After the launch of its main website, [NewAmerica.org](http://newamerica.org), in late 2014, Wiredcraft was brought in to maintain and extend the growing online presence.
