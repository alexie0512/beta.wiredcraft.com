## Want to stop face-palming at work? 

You're tired of transcribing emails from your boss' chicken scratch. Are you sick of being just another office administrator? 

You find yourself dreaming of having your opinion matter, after all you are a bilingual badass. You want to be part of a team that works on meaningful projects. 

Or maybe you don't have a job yet? 

What are you waiting for? Join our team. 

## What You'll Do as Master of Operations

1. **Actual responsibilities.** No fetching coffee & doughnuts, or manually updating a thousand rows in an Excel spreadsheet doesnâ€™t qualify. You want to weight in decisions and make an actual contribution to the work your team is pulling through.
1. **Help keep our ship afloat.** Help with office purchasing, mail, accounting, etc...
1. **Be the sales team's saint and keep them organized.** Provide invoicing for customers, ongoing accounting, contracting, etc...
1. **Help grow our team** (provide HR support for the Berlin office recruiting and on-boarding)
1. **Keep our team happy by planning out-of-this-world team building events**

## We're Looking for Someone Who...

- **Has a neatly organized desk and calendar**
- **Is fluent in German and conversational English,**
- **Can read both Shakespeare and Marx** (original versions, of course),
- **Patient enough to get through the administration mazes,**
- **Not afraid of leading and getting sh*t done,**
- **Transparent is your middle name.** You can work with a distributed team and keep things organized and in the clear, 
- **Eager to learn (a lot),**
- **Not afraid to experiment.**
