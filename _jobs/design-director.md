## Enough with the BS design tasks

You’ve mastered the tao of CSS, SASS, Sketch and HTML5. You can whip out a UI for an app blindfolded, with one hand on the back on an iPad. You doodle your way through a Moleskine a day. You meditation consists of coffee and checking out HN, Dribbble or Designer News.

Problem is, you’re stuck at your current job:

- You keep on being asked to build small, crappy, 10-pages websites.
- You spend your day making the logo bigger for clients who don’t know diddly squat about design.
- The dev team is as friendly as a hangovered Chuck Norris and doesn’t care about your opinion.
- Or better yet, you don’t have a job.

## What you deserve as a designer

1. **More responsibilities**: your job doesn’t end at Sketch or Illustrator. Your input should be sought through the whole design and development process.
1. **Work that actually means something**, building products that solve real problems (aka not another "Yo app").
1. **The opportunity (and time) to improve your craft and acquire new skills**, may this be programming complex data visualizations with D3.js or foosball.

## We want somebody who is...

- **Wicked smart**,
- **Understands UI + UX**,
- **Can come up with a decent design on his or her own**,
- **Can prototype stuff with HTML/CSS**,
- **Eager to learn (a lot)**,
- **Not afraid of leading and getting sh*t done**.
