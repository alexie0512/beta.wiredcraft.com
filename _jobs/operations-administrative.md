## Looking for a job that won't keep you locked in a chair all afternoon?

Are you sick of being just another office administrator? 

You find yourself dreaming of having your opinion matter, after all, you are a bilingual badass. You want to be part of a team that works on meaningful projects. 

You're accomplished, and it shows, and you're looking for a position with an international company that not only builds stuff that matters, but will have you work on things that matter, like recruitment, human resources, accounting, event planning, etc...

What are you waiting for? Join our team. 

## What You'll Do as Operations Guru

Working closely with our CEO and marketing team, you'll...

1. **Keep our ship afloat.** Manage office purchasing, facility maintenance, document translation, taxes, social security, etc...
1. **Grow and support our team.** Supervise recruiting, on-boarding, work visas, payroll and manage our [KinHR system](https://kinhr.com/).
1. **Event planning** (making sure our Meetups, [JS Conference China](http://2015.jsconf.cn/en/) and team-building events are mishap-free).
1. **Handle the monies** (keep track of purchasing, petty cash, reimbursement, accounting, etc...) You don't need to be an accountant, but you do need to have money sense. 
1. **Help out our foreigners** (when the taxi driver's yelling and the new laowai doesn't know what to do). 
1. **Chinese Marketing** Scale our online presence for our Chinese audience: website, SNS, etc. 
1. **Be the front-end receiver** for office goodies, snacks, and communications.

- **Familiar with Chinese social media/marketing tools** (Sina, Weibo, etc...); additional Chinese marketing experience is a plus,
- **Has a broad understanding of the technology sector,**
- **Transparent is your middle name.** You can work with a distributed team and keep things organized and in the clear,
- **Not afraid to lead and get sh*t done,**
- **Willing to be challenged and eager to learn,**
- **Not afraid to experiment.**
