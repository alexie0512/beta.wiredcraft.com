## Tired of your genius being stifled by your manager?

You're looking for an opportunity to work on real stuff, skimming through job ads realizing they are the same old thing. And a lot of it is starting to sound like you'll be stuck shoveling through tons of low level, boring tasks that nobody else wants to deal with. 

You have been dying to try a new marketing plan, but you are constantly blocked by your manager (overlord). You’re tired of doing the same thing every day;  you want a dynamic marketing job that lets you dabble, experiment and grow.  


## Here is what we have to offer

1. **Actual responsibilities**. Wasting time on reports that end up in the trash and manually updating a thousand rows in an Excel spreadsheet doesn't qualify. You want to weight in decisions and make an actual contribution to the work your team is pulling through.
1. **Work that actually means something**, working on products that solve real problems (aka not another "Yo app").
1. **The opportunity (and time) to experiment and learn.** Testing and measuring is a big part of marketing for us. Even if it means failing a few times (or often), you’ll have the freedom to figure out what works and what doesn't.


## We're looking for somebody who is...

- **Familiar with online marketing tools, approaches and strategies.** Ideally 2+ years of marketing experience. Think analytics (Google Analytics, Mixpanel), newsletters (Mailchimp), campaigns, SEO, A/B testing, etc... 
- **Comfortable with Web and mobile technologies**. You don't have to be a programmer, but some basic HTML skills would be a plus (we'll teach you otherwise),
- **Friendly (like a golden retriever) and organized**,  you’ll plan and be the face of Wiredcraft at events that we host - like the [Hacker News Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Shanghai-Hacker-News-Meetup/) and [JS Conf China](http://jsconf.cn/)
- **Smart** (with a great sense of humor, and who likes long walk on the beach),
- **Good at writing** (you don't need to be Shakespeare),
- **Not completely color blind**, we like to design beautiful products and experiences,
- **Eager to learn (a lot)**,
- **Not afraid to experiment**.

Don't sweat it if you're not a perfect match: we don't mind teaching people.
