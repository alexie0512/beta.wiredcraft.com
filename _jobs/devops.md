## Tired of fixing other people's mess?

Tired of having the latest release dropped on you to be deployed in prod right before everybody gets off for the weekend? How do you like being the one making things work on production when "it works fine on my local"? And don't you love being the only one dealing with the app crashing at 2:00 AM on Saturday?

**It isn't much fun to be relegated to the role of "that guy who'll make sure things are running in prod"**.

## You deserve a lot more...

1. **Help and respect from the rest of the team**. You shouldn't be the only one able to deploy code. Actually, it should be auomated, but developers should have a sense of where to look when things break.
1. **The opportunity to do the right thing, with the right tech**. You need time to learn about new tools, and time to script or automate things. We use a lot of Python, Ansible and Docker, but we'd be thrilled if you could challenge our position and help us invest in our future stack.
1. **Having a say in how things are built**. If you're gonna help with designing the infrastructure our software runs on, you should be part of the discussion right from the beginning, before developers even write a single line of code.
1. **Work that has an impact**. May this be managing the voter information for 30 million people or helping the biggest electronic manufacturer get their sh*t together, we're not the kind of team to work on yet another "yo app".

## What you'd be doing with us

You would work directly with Vincent, our beloved infrastructure tzar, mostly on sysadmin/Ops/DevOps stuff:

- Help **design architectures** to support things like the electoral software for the Myanmar elections (not kidding).
- **Automate the heck out of anything** that comes near one of your servers (with Python, shell and Ansible, or anything that gets the job done).
- **Monitor all the things!**
- **Knock some goddam sense into the developers**. Our team gives a damn about performance and not burning servers down. We automate what we can and make the rest accessible, most of the team ends up running things themselves on servers at one point or another.
- **Help troubleshooting** (sh*t happens and not everybody is a *NIX god).
- **Innovate**, **bring new tools** to the team or simply help shape **best practices** that our team should adopt.

## We're looking for somebody who is....

- **Smart & eager to learn (a lot)** (with a great sense of humor, and who likes long walk on the beach),
- **Has Ops chops**. We work a lot with **Python**, __*NIX__, **Docker** and **Ansible**, but we hope you'll know a whole lot more (Collectd, CouchBase, AWS/Digital Ocean/Linode, Xen, HAProxy, SSL, ...).
- **Interested in automating yourself out of work**. We're pretty anal about scripting as much of what we do on servers. We hope you are too and understand it's the best way to free you up to work on more interesting things.
- **Up to date with modern practices**. We mentioned DevOps (I know), but we'd like you to be on top of things like continuous integration, continuous testing, immutable infrastructure, microservices...
- **Comfortable with Web and mobile technologies**. We like our developers to know how the servers running their code are set up, similarly we want Ops folks to understand what developers are building (DevOps FTW).
- **Not afraid to experiment** and yes, sometimes, burn an AWS instance (or 10).

Don't sweat it if you're not a perfect match: we don't mind teaching you  as long as you care about getting sh*t done and want to work on interesting challenges.
