## Tired of working for a-holes?

Another week, another round of bullshit. You know that by the end of the week you'll have once again saved your boss' ass half a dozen times. Really, apart from taking credit for your work and making things harder than it should, he's not doing much.

You're spending way too much time avoiding "update meetings" with your colleagues while still being in charge of leading on design AND code... AND updating the client. You like the responsibilities but you're getting sick of not having a say in how things get done.

## Wanna write your own ticket?

Ideally, you should have the freedom and leverage that would allow you to grow as a leader;

- If you decide that a process sucks, even if it's *how things have been done for years*â„¢, you should be able to drop it and try to do better.
- You'd like to influence the culture of your team, starting with getting to pick who's on it.
- Similarly, it would be good to be decide of what you'll work on and with whom.
- Finally, you shouldn't be the one always left with the sh*tty end of the stick when things get difficult on a project. You like being the hero once in a while, but you want to know your colleagues care as much as you do.

**Well, I have good news for you**: we're looking for somebody to join our founder, Ronan, in Washington, DC to lead our US expansion. You'll get to:

- **Wear several hats and help shape what our US team will look like**.
- **Work on stuff that actually matters**, think the elections of Myanmar, Open Data platforms for the World Bank or building mobile applications for tens of millions of Starbucks customers.
- **Do it the "right way" and surround yourself with a bunch of really smart people**.
- **Decide of your own growth**. We're really serious about personal development and constantly encourage each other to learn new things.

## We want somebody who is...

- **Smart** (with a great sense of humor, and who likes long walk on the beach),
- **A good communicator**, able to empathize with both our colleagues and our clients,
- **Sensitive to design, UI and UX**, we like to [design beautiful things](/blog/how-we-design-products/) and you should be able to appreciate that,
- **Comfortable with Web and mobile technologies**. Ideally you'd know how to build a simple app.
- **Detail driven**, you should be the one catching subtle mistakes before we push things in production,
- **Good at writing** (you don't need to be Shakespeare),
- **Eager to learn (a lot)**,
- **Not afraid of leading and getting sh*t done**.
- **Preferably US-based**.
