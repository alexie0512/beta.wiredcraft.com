## Tired of the same old, sh*tty stack?

You desperately want to play with the cool new things like Node.js or Golang. As soon as you're home, you fire up your editor and start playing with the latest framework you heard of on Hacker News.

At work, you're left maintaining an aging PHP codebase. Every suggestion you make for using something more up to date is met with resistance from colleagues who don't feel like learning new things. You built a couple proof of concepts but they never made it to production.

## Stop wasting your time, quit your job!

Why even bother when you could be working with an awesome team on challenging projects? Join us and have a blast:

1. **You'll use the latest technologies, from Node.js to Golang, or whatever else works for you**. We're always experimenting with new things and open to change when it makes sense. For example, we started working with Node.js in 2010 and React in 2011. We also use tons of current tools like Docker.
1. **You'll get to work on Open Source**. Most of us are contributing back to projects, sending PR or simply publishing our own side projects. We also organize meetups and conferences, like [JSConf China](http://2015.jsconf.cn/en/) (over 650+ people showed up this year).
1. **You'll build awesome sh*t**; we build really impressive things for the World Bank, Starbucks, the United Nations, CNN... And when we're not busy doing Big data work for USAID or building the next generation of mobile apps for the Chinese market with Starbucks, we work on our own products ([devo.ps](http://devo.ps), [chato.ps](http://chato.ps), [SweepBoard](http://SweepBoard.com), [ClassyDocs](http://classydocs.com)...).

## Who are we looking for?

We'd like to find somebody who:

- **Loves working with Node.js, Golang or Python (or all of that)**. We build microservices with [LoopBack](http://loopback.io), libraries for iOS and Android apps with Golang and Web apps with Django. Our front-end folks are also obsessed with Javascript, may this be React, D3.js or AngularJS.
- **Understand how to build loosely coupled architectures**. [We have our sh*t together when it comes to designing products](http://wiredcraft.com/blog/how-we-design-products/) and are similarly smart with our software. We like to use the right tool for the right job, prefering interconnected microservices rather than large bloated apps. We abuse Docker and get to tackle very complicated challenges.
- **Likes to learn and experiment**. There's rarely a dull moment at the office, we're constantly trying out new tools and framework. If you like to learn and grow your skills, you'll love working with us; we encourage our colleagues to become [T-shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills).
- **Is all about shipping and getting things done**. We're increasingly distributed, with offices in Berlin, Washington DC and Shanghai. We're a no-nonsense  type of team; we invest heavily in asynchronous communications and let actions speak for themselves.
